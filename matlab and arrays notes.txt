3) b' for transpose
4) ; means new line.
5) in clc variables will be accessible in workplace
6)To merge 2 mat== [ c  const ]  provided both combined give a proper matrix].
7)element= mat(row, column)
8)r3=au( 3, 1:2:3)  ( these  element of that row)
  (3, :) last num
  (1: end) full row of given row num.
  (1:3) start from 1 go till 3.[default increment is 1]
9) (3,1:2:3)   we are giving increment of 2.
    it will display 1st and (1+2) 3rd value. wont give further as there are no further roes.
10)c4= au(1:3,4)  for columns. 
11) au(1:2:4)  it will go element wise with 2 increment.
   au(1:2) go element wise with default increment 1.
12) rref(au)-- directly gives reduced row echleon form.



1) ascii value: -32;
2) char to int-- 0 -'a'+ 'A';
